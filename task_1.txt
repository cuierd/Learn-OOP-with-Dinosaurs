**** By the way, we think there are some mistakes in the codes. ****
1. in line 60 and line 90, it should be:
	def __init__(self, name, age):
instead of:
	def __init(self, name, age):
Otherwise, you are defining a private function, names "init", and there is no need to 
use super().__init__ to inherit. If def __init(self, name, age) takes one more argument 
because the subclass wants to overwrite, then error will raise.

2. in line 68 and line 98, should be:
	if Brachiosaurus.check_food(t):
	if Velociraptor.check_food(t):
instead of :
	if self.check_food(t):
In most of the cases, the output would be the same. But maybe classmethod should be 
called by classname.classmethod(), otherwise, it can cause confusion when the object has 
a method the same as classmethod. 

Maybe we are wrong, please feel free to correct us.
