a) How much time did you spend roughly on this exercise?
A whole day, from 10 a.m. in the morning to 1 a.m at middle night.


b) How difficult was this exercise? Was the difficulty too high, too low or just right?
It is doable, but time-consuming.

Some questions are ambiguous. e.g. We understand the question in this way while doing
task1, later find out the you mean that way. And we need to change our codes.


c) Do you feel more comfortable now with the topics from the exercise and lectures?

Yes, the exercise is very helpful. Thank you.
But I(Cui) feel still haven't get the beauty of class. 
I use it almost in the old way(treat class as a group of functions who are relatives) 
rather than the mysterious object-oriented way.
